The beautiful thing about GIS is that maps are dynamic. Layers can
individually be shown and hidden and information can be presented more
or less prominently based on the task at hand.

This is what *Map Themes* (before QGIS 3.0 known as *Visibility
Presets*) are for.

1.  Style the map and layers to your requirements
2.  Save it as a named Map Theme
3.  Load the project and your device and
