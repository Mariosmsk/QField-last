title: Add a series of pictures to a feature
---

You can add one or more pictures to a feature. Below you find an example
how to proceed.

Creating two tables
===================

We will need two tables. One table where the features are stored and one
with a list of pictures.

**Apiary**
----------

-   `id` (UUID)
-   `geometry`
-   \...

**Apiary\_pictures**
--------------------

-   `id`
-   `apiary_id` (UUID)
-   `path` (TEXT)
-   \...

Relations
=========

Create a relation with:

-   `apiary` Referenced layer
-   `id` Referenced field
-   `apiary_picture` Referencing layer
-   `apiary_id` Referencing field
-   `strength` Composition

::: {.container .clearer .text-center}

Widgets
=======

apiary
------

Set the default value of the field id to `uuid()`. No need to show it in
the form.

::: {.container .clearer .text-center}
!![widgets](../assets/images/add-1-n-pictures-widgets_hive.png)
:::

Set the relation widget to `Many to one relation` and add the relation
to the form

::: {.container .clearer .text-center}
!![widgets2](../assets/images/add-1-n-pictures-widgets_hive2.png)
:::

picture
-------

Set the widget type of the field path to `attachment` and add it to the
form
