Geologic mapping is completed using paper maps and/or digital devices for data collection. The goal is to improve the geologic mapping workflow by entering data directly in the field, create quality data with consistent terms, and reference existing geoscience data in the field. Project preparation Prior to starting in QField, a geologic mapping geopackage was designed to collect vector data including point station, structure, photo, and sample layers as well as line and polygon layers for contacts, faults, alteration, and geology. Attribute fields are customized for ease of data entry and data quality assurance using value maps, defaults (value or expression), and constraints within the Attributes Form. For example, the structural layer includes: Coordinates Fields with default value x and y coordinates from GPS data Structure type Value map (drop down list) with structural features (e.g., bedding, cleavage, lineation), set with a \"not null\" constraint Azimuth and dip Integers with range set from 0-360 and 0-90, respectively Date Default value current date and time when feature created ::: {.container .clearer .text-center} {width=\"700px\"} ::: Symbology and labels are customized for each layer, including embedded SVG symbols for structural features that are rotated with the azimuth field. In addition to field data, base maps and historic data are compiled into geopackages for reference. Base maps include vector topographic data and raster orthophotos. Raster geophysical data and vector geochemical data are included if available, as well as historic geologic mapping. Map themes are designed to quickly toggle between geologic mapping, geophysics, and geochemistry views. Data collection Field data collection includes adding point data for map stations, structures, photos, and samples. Polygons and lines are drawn freehand with a stylus or adding vertices manually. Location and direction of travel are displayed using internal device GPS (or external GPS device linked via Bluetooth), historic vector and raster layers can be viewed relative to location. Current and historic vector layers can be searched and viewed in QField. Field data are synchronized in QGIS followed by a short data clean up and verification process. The QGIS project is then exported back to QField for additional data collection. ::: {.container .clearer .text-center} {width=\"700px\"} {width=\"700px\"} ::: Structural data collection may be upgraded with future development of a geologic compass feature. https://github.com/opengisch/QField/issues/1882 Results Final geologic maps and analysis are prepared directly from field data sets with no need to digitize field data.

Accurate mapping and monitoring patterns of land use and land cover (LULC) over time at an appropriate scale is important for informing landscape management, policies, and climate-smart sustainable development. Fiji's Ministry of Forestry is collaboratively developing an approach with the Universities of Sydney (USYD), Western Australia (UWA) and the South Pacific (USP) to produce an inter-annual LULC map using Sentinel-2 satellite data, and freely available geospatial tools. QFIeld is being used for collecting ground truth data in the landscape for training and validation of the LULC map. Workflow The LULC ground truth collection form was designed in QGIS. A set of predefined ground truth plot locations were generated based on a stratification of satellite data within the study area. The form, predefined plots, and appropriate offline background layers were packaged in QGIS and then loaded onto each of the tablets used by the field team (Figure 1). A team member navigated to a predefined plot in QField and created a ground truth point at the location and labelled the point with the most appropriate pre-defined LULC class (Figure 2). Data collected from all tablets was combined into one ground truth data collection in QGIS. Image interpretation using the OpenForis platform will be used to increase the number of ground truth plots. The final ground truth collection will be imported into Google Earth Engine to produce the LULC map and calculate the map accuracy. ::: {.container .clearer .text-center} {width=\"400px\"} {width=\"400px\"} ::: Preliminary Results and Future Work An example of a preliminary land cover map is shown in Figure 3. An important objective from our work is to transfer skills and build capacity with local stakeholders to continue to update the LULC map on an annual basis as well as to expand the map to include other communities, catchments and forestry areas across Fiji.

The supervised method implies the collection of ground truth parcels, i.e. location and geo-referencing of a set of parcels of each land cover class on the ground, preferably spread all over the study areas. Both areas are 50 km2 wide and their nature (savannahs and rural areas, where roads are mainly narrow clay tracks) imply to move around in motorbike or by feet. In addition, one could quickly get lost in the rural labyrinth tracks in absence of a map. We hence needed light and very portable equipment, as well as a way to easily explore the area without getting lost. Project preparation We created a QGIS project with the Spot image and a layer to collect the ground data . We first converted our Spot image to a Geopackage raster, and built pyramids so as to get quick rendering in QField. The whole image (50 km2 at 1.5 m spatial resolution with 3 bands) weighted approximately 800 MB, which enabled us to load it in our tablet without the need to add any extra memory. We created a vector layer to draw our ground truth parcels (i.e. polygons of land cover parcels). It contained a field to identify the land cover type, some fields to take pictures and a field for eventual additional notes. We then uploaded the project in QField in our tablet. Field work On the field, we were able to move around easily in motorbike without getting lost, thanks to our location displayed on QField with the satellite image as background. When a parcel of interest was identified, we were able to draw its perimeter in QField and very easily fill-in the proper information on the attribute table (land cover type, pictures). When hesitating on the land cover type to attribute to a given parcel, we were able, in \"live\" (i.e. on the ground), to quickly look at previously retrieved parcels and compare them to the parcel of interest (with the pictures and the satellite image). We were able, without any extra effort at the end each field working day, to see the progress of the work: which pieces of our study area we had covered, which remained to explore, how many parcels we had got for each land cover class and how many remained to retrieve. This is very appreciable in such conditions, where work can be testing and nights can be shorts. Back in office, we did not have to realize fastidious and time-consuming work such as digitalizing the parcels from a traditional GPS point layer, linking the pictures to our land cover layer, etc., which traditionally took days of work. ::: {.container .clearer .text-center} {width=\"200px\"} {width=\"200px\"} {width=\"200px\"} {width=\"200px\"} :::","title":"Use of Qfield in the context of ground-truth data collection work of malaria transmitting mosquitoes"},{"location":"de/case-studies/mosquito-malario-ground-truth-data-collection/#goal-and-field-constraints","text":"For a research work aiming at improving the knowledge on the environment of the mosquitoes that transmit malaria, the French Research Institute for Sustainable Development needed to generate a land cover map of two rural areas in Africa, one in Burkina Faso and one in Ivory Coast.

Vanilla is an important commercial crop in Vava'u. The purpose of the survey was to map the extent of vanilla plantations and obtain estimates of the numbers of vanilla plants, area under vanilla cultivation, and the proportion of plantations that were managed or neglected. This information is being used by MAFF on Vava'u for agricultural planning and decision making. Extension officers were trained to use QField at MAFF's trial plantation. Following training, a team of seven extension officers conducted the survey of vanilla plantations. In total, 140 vanilla plantations were surveyed. The survey data was processed and visualised using QGIS and a Shiny dashboard application. QField enabled MAFF staff to view reference layers of farm boundaries on mobile devices in the field and map the extent of vanilla plantations within each farm. Maps of the vanilla plantations and summary statistics reporting the number of vanilla plantations, total area surveyed, and the estimated yield for plantations were produced. Capturing this information using QField enabled MAFF to identify that large areas under vanilla cultivation were in a neglected management condition. This data, and the insights generated from it, were used for reporting at the national level and presentations to senior ministry staff at the MAFF headquarters on Tongatapu in July 2020. Following the vanilla survey, there are plans to train MAFF extension staff based on the main island (Tongatapu) and other island groups to use QField for crop and farm surveys. The MAFF team in Vava'u are currently using QField to map areas cultivated by grower groups, the different crops under cultivation, and problems farmers are facing with cultivation in all districts on the island. The government is using this information as part of a process to monitor and evaluate allocated funds that support farming initiatives and the food security program of the Government.

Two satellites images (Spot 6 at 1.5 meters spatial resolutions) are used as input of a supervised object-based image classification for this work. The supervised method implies the collection of ground truth parcels, i.e. location and geo-referencing of a set of parcels of each land cover class on the ground, preferably spread all over the study areas. Both areas are 50 km2 wide and their nature (savannahs and rural areas, where roads are mainly narrow clay tracks) imply to move around in motorbike or by feet. In addition, one could quickly get lost in the rural labyrinth tracks in absence of a map. We hence needed light and very portable equipment, as well as a way to easily explore the area without getting lost. Project preparation We created a QGIS project with the Spot image and a layer to collect the ground data . We first converted our Spot image to a Geopackage raster, and built pyramids so as to get quick rendering in QField. The whole image (50 km2 at 1.5 m spatial resolution with 3 bands) weighted approximately 800 MB, which enabled us to load it in our tablet without the need to add any extra memory. We created a vector layer to draw our ground truth parcels (i.e. polygons of land cover parcels). It contained a field to identify the land cover type, some fields to take pictures and a field for eventual additional notes. We then uploaded the project in QField in our tablet. Field work On the field, we were able to move around easily in motorbike without getting lost, thanks to our location displayed on QField with the satellite image as background. When a parcel of interest was identified, we were able to draw its perimeter in QField and very easily fill-in the proper information on the attribute table (land cover type, pictures). When hesitating on the land cover type to attribute to a given parcel, we were able, in \"live\" (i.e. on the ground), to quickly look at previously retrieved parcels and compare them to the parcel of interest (with the pictures and the satellite image). We were able, without any extra effort at the end each field working day, to see the progress of the work: which pieces of our study area we had covered, which remained to explore, how many parcels we had got for each land cover class and how many remained to retrieve. This is very appreciable in such conditions, where work can be testing and nights can be shorts. Back in office, we did not have to realize fastidious and time-consuming work such as digitalizing the parcels from a traditional GPS point layer, linking the pictures to our land cover layer, etc., which traditionally took days of work. ::: {.container .clearer .text-center} {width=\"200px\"} {width=\"200px\"} {width=\"200px\"} {width=\"200px\"} :::","title":"Use of Qfield in the context of ground-truth data collection work of malaria transmitting mosquitoes"},{"location":"de/old-doc/case-studies/mosquito-malario-ground-truth-data-collection/#goal-and-field-constraints","text":"For a research work aiming at improving the knowledge on the environment of the mosquitoes that transmit malaria, the French Research Institute for Sustainable Development needed to generate a land cover map of two rural areas in Africa, one in Burkina Faso and one in Ivory Coast.

It\\'s possible to add, delete and open them. The visual identification of the list entries are done a Display Expression on the child layer. Key handling Since the parents primary keys are used as foreign keys on the referencing child features, these primary keys must be save to use even after the synchronization back to the original data. Therefore we recommend to use stable values such as UUIDs for primary keys. Child features can be added before the parent is finaly saved - means while adding a parent. But it\\'s blocked if there is no valid primary key on the parent or the constraints are violated. In case the adding of the parent feature is canceled after there have been some childs added already, the childs are deleted by cascade. Many-To-Many relations On many-to-many relationships, according to the cardinality setting in the QGIS Vector Layer Properties, on adding, deleting or opening an entry in the list effects directly the child layer (on direct cardinality) or the linking table (on many-to-one cardinality). The second case is usually used when there are additional relation information (e.g. percentage) in the linking table. ::: {.container .clearer .text-center} {width=\"500px\"} ::: In case of the many-to-one cardinality on many-to-many relations the Display Expression needs to be set on the linking table.

They can be based on the geometry or expression variables. ::: {.container .clearer .text-center} {width=\"600px\"} ::: Additional variables In QField, there are some additional variables available regarding the current positioning information. [position_coordinate]{.title-ref} (Geometry in WGS84!) : Lon, Lat, Altitude as delivered by the sensor. Is also available when the crosshair is not snapped to the sensor. [position_timestamp]{.title-ref} (DateTime) : Timestamp of the position information [position_direction]{.title-ref} (float) : Direction in degrees from true north. [position_ground_speed]{.title-ref} (float) : Groundspeed in meters / second. [position_magnetic_variation]{.title-ref} (float) : The angle between the horizontal component of the magnetic field and true north, in degrees. Also known as magnetic declination. A positive value indicates a clockwise direction from true north and a negative value indicates a counter-clockwise direction. [position_horizontal_accuracy]{.title-ref} (float) : The horizontal accuracy of the coordinate (in meters). [position_vertical_accuracy]{.title-ref} (float) : The vertical accuracy of the coordinate (in meters). [position_vertical_speed]{.title-ref} (float) : The value of the vertical speed in meters per second. Common use cases Insert positioning information as variable: @position_horizontal_accuracy Insert the current date and time: now() Insert the length of the digitized line: length($geometry) Configure global variables on the device and insert them. @operator_name If you want to assign a region code based on the location where a new feature is inserted, you can do so by using an aggregate expression: aggregate( layer:='regions', aggregate:='max', expression:=\"code\", filter:=intersects( $geometry, geometry( @parent ) ) ) Editable The editable flag of fields is respected. Remember last values QField offers a much more fine-grained control over the last used values and ignores the QGIS setting.

Configuring the offline editing functionality and synchronizing changes back. Workflow To get a quick overview of the process, here is a list of typical steps: Create a QField package. This is a working copy in a separate folder. Copy the QField package to the target device. Go out and collect data. Copy the modified data back to your desktop computer. Synchronize the modified data with your database or files. Installation In QGIS, open the plugin library and search for qfield sync . Select the plugin in the list and click on Install . ! Configuration The project configuration is saved in the master .qgs project file. This way it is possible to pre-configure a project once and use it repeatedly. Layer configuration In the project configuration dialog, an action can be defined for each layer individually. Depending on the layer type, different types of actions are available. Copy : The layer will be copied to the package folder. This is only available for file-based layers. No action : The layer source will be left untouched. This is only available for non-file-based layers like WMS, WFS, Postgis... Offline editing : A working copy of the layer is copied into the package folder. Every change which is done in the packaged project during work is recorded in a changelog. When synchronizing the changes back later on, this log will be replayed and all changes also be applied to the main data base. There is no conflict handling in place. Remove : The layer will be removed from the working copy. This is useful if a layer is used in the basemap and will not be available in the packaged project. Base map configuration A base map is a raster layer which is added as the bottommost layer to the packaged project file. If the base map option is enabled, a base map will be rendered, whenever the project is packaged. The area of interest - the extent which will be rendered -will be chosen at packaging time. There are two possible sources for a base map: Layer : A raster layer. This is useful to take an offline copy of an online layer like a WMS or to take a working copy of an unsupported format like an ECW or MrSID layer. Map Theme : A map theme. This is useful to create a base map based on a combination of several layers with styling. These layers can then be removed from the working package and do not need to be rendered on the device. This can save some disk space and battery on the device. The tile size defines the spatial resolution. It determines the number of map units per pixel. If the map canvas CRS has meters as units and tile size is set to 1, each raster pixel will have a spatial extent of 1x1 m, if it is set to 1000, each raster pixel will have a spatial extent of 1 square kilometer. Offline editing configuration If only synchronize features in area of interest is checked, only features which are within the extent of the map canvas as packaging time will be copied to the offline editing working copy. Package for Qfield Once the project is configured, package it in a folder. This folder will contain the .qgs and the data used in it. Copy the folder on your device. Open Qfield, open the project and start collecting data. Make also sure to save the QGIS project using the regular Save As of QGIS as you\\'ll have to re-open it later when you want to synchronize the changes. Synchronize from Qfield When you want to synchronize what you have collected, re-open the project in QGIS (the one you saved with a regular Save As). Copy the project folder from your device to your computer and use the Synchronize from Qfield menu to synchronize your changes from the protable project to the main project. Make sure that you synchronize your data back only once.

This is useful to create a base map based on a combination of several layers with styling. These layers can then be removed from the working package and do not need to be rendered on the device. This can save some disk space and battery on the device. The tile size defines the spatial resolution. It determines the number of map units per pixel. If the map canvas CRS has meters as units and tile size is set to 1, each raster pixel will have a spatial extent of 1x1 m, if it is set to 1000, each raster pixel will have a spatial extent of 1 square kilometer.","title":"Base map configuration"},{"location":"de/synchronise/qfieldsync/#offline-editing-configuration","text":"If only synchronize features in area of interest is checked, only features which are within the extent of the map canvas as packaging time will be copied to the offline editing working copy.","title":"Offline editing configuration"},{"location":"de/synchronise/qfieldsync/#package-for-qfield","text":"Once the project is configured, package it in a folder.

The goal is to improve the geologic mapping workflow by entering data directly in the field, create quality data with consistent terms, and reference existing geoscience data in the field. Project preparation Prior to starting in QField, a geologic mapping geopackage was designed to collect vector data including point station, structure, photo, and sample layers as well as line and polygon layers for contacts, faults, alteration, and geology. Attribute fields are customized for ease of data entry and data quality assurance using value maps, defaults (value or expression), and constraints within the Attributes Form. For example, the structural layer includes: Coordinates Fields with default value x and y coordinates from GPS data Structure type Value map (drop down list) with structural features (e.g., bedding, cleavage, lineation), set with a \"not null\" constraint Azimuth and dip Integers with range set from 0-360 and 0-90, respectively Date Default value current date and time when feature created ::: {.container .clearer .text-center} {width=\"700px\"} ::: Symbology and labels are customized for each layer, including embedded SVG symbols for structural features that are rotated with the azimuth field.

Good supervision during the monitoring period in spring is thus very important. At the same time the amount of collected data is a significant bureaucratic challenge. Until 2018 printed paper maps were used to collect the data in the field. Major disadvantages of the analogue system were: orientation in the field was rather difficult without GPS positioning all results had to be counted and transferred to data tables and GIS manually, transmission errors were likely (about 18,000 observations are collected every year) data could only be reviewed after the monitoring period and unlikely observations could not be checked directly For this reason, we have implemented a digital monitoring workflow using the power of QField, the advantages of a cloud storage system and the computational power of R.

In an evaluation survey all participants stated that they preferred using the tablet rather than the analogue paper maps for field work. The use of the custom QField project was evaluated as straightforward and easy. In total more than 18.000 data points were collected in the field. Due to automatized data treatment we saved a huge amount of office time and avoided transmission errors. Also, data collected with tablets and GPS-positioning will be of much higher spatial accuracy. In the future we will thus fully switch to tablet based fieldwork.

Due to automatized data treatment we saved a huge amount of office time and avoided transmission errors. Also, data collected with tablets and GPS-positioning will be of much higher spatial accuracy.

Two satellites images (Spot 6 at 1.5 meters spatial resolutions) are used as input of a supervised object-based image classification for this work. The supervised method implies the collection of ground truth parcels, i.e. location and geo-referencing of a set of parcels of each land cover class on the ground, preferably spread all over the study areas. Both areas are 50 km2 wide and their nature (savannahs and rural areas, where roads are mainly narrow clay tracks) imply to move around in motorbike or by feet. In addition, one could quickly get lost in the rural labyrinth tracks in absence of a map. We hence needed light and very portable equipment, as well as a way to easily explore the area without getting lost. Project preparation We created a QGIS project with the Spot image and a layer to collect the ground data . We first converted our Spot image to a Geopackage raster, and built pyramids so as to get quick rendering in QField. The whole image (50 km2 at 1.5 m spatial resolution with 3 bands) weighted approximately 800 MB, which enabled us to load it in our tablet without the need to add any extra memory. We created a vector layer to draw our ground truth parcels (i.e. polygons of land cover parcels). It contained a field to identify the land cover type, some fields to take pictures and a field for eventual additional notes. We then uploaded the project in QField in our tablet. Field work On the field, we were able to move around easily in motorbike without getting lost, thanks to our location displayed on QField with the satellite image as background. When a parcel of interest was identified, we were able to draw its perimeter in QField and very easily fill-in the proper information on the attribute table (land cover type, pictures). When hesitating on the land cover type to attribute to a given parcel, we were able, in \"live\" (i.e. on the ground), to quickly look at previously retrieved parcels and compare them to the parcel of interest (with the pictures and the satellite image). We were able, without any extra effort at the end each field working day, to see the progress of the work: which pieces of our study area we had covered, which remained to explore, how many parcels we had got for each land cover class and how many remained to retrieve. This is very appreciable in such conditions, where work can be testing and nights can be shorts. Back in office, we did not have to realize fastidious and time-consuming work such as digitalizing the parcels from a traditional GPS point layer, linking the pictures to our land cover layer, etc., which traditionally took days of work. ::: {.container .clearer .text-center} {width=\"200px\"} {width=\"200px\"} {width=\"200px\"} {width=\"200px\"} :::","title":"Use of Qfield in the context of ground-truth data collection work of malaria transmitting mosquitoes"},{"location":"en/case-studies/mosquito-malario-ground-truth-data-collection/#goal-and-field-constraints","text":"For a research work aiming at improving the knowledge on the environment of the mosquitoes that transmit malaria, the French Research Institute for Sustainable Development needed to generate a land cover map of two rural areas in Africa, one in Burkina Faso and one in Ivory Coast.

Vanilla is an important commercial crop in Vava'u. The purpose of the survey was to map the extent of vanilla plantations and obtain estimates of the numbers of vanilla plants, area under vanilla cultivation, and the proportion of plantations that were managed or neglected. This information is being used by MAFF on Vava'u for agricultural planning and decision making. Extension officers were trained to use QField at MAFF's trial plantation. Following training, a team of seven extension officers conducted the survey of vanilla plantations. In total, 140 vanilla plantations were surveyed. The survey data was processed and visualised using QGIS and a Shiny dashboard application. QField enabled MAFF staff to view reference layers of farm boundaries on mobile devices in the field and map the extent of vanilla plantations within each farm. Maps of the vanilla plantations and summary statistics reporting the number of vanilla plantations, total area surveyed, and the estimated yield for plantations were produced. Capturing this information using QField enabled MAFF to identify that large areas under vanilla cultivation were in a neglected management condition. This data, and the insights generated from it, were used for reporting at the national level and presentations to senior ministry staff at the MAFF headquarters on Tongatapu in July 2020. Following the vanilla survey, there are plans to train MAFF extension staff based on the main island (Tongatapu) and other island groups to use QField for crop and farm surveys. The MAFF team in Vava'u are currently using QField to map areas cultivated by grower groups, the different crops under cultivation, and problems farmers are facing with cultivation in all districts on the island. The government is using this information as part of a process to monitor and evaluate allocated funds that support farming initiatives and the food security program of the Government.

Two satellites images (Spot 6 at 1.5 meters spatial resolutions) are used as input of a supervised object-based image classification for this work. The supervised method implies the collection of ground truth parcels, i.e. location and geo-referencing of a set of parcels of each land cover class on the ground, preferably spread all over the study areas. Both areas are 50 km2 wide and their nature (savannahs and rural areas, where roads are mainly narrow clay tracks) imply to move around in motorbike or by feet. In addition, one could quickly get lost in the rural labyrinth tracks in absence of a map. We hence needed light and very portable equipment, as well as a way to easily explore the area without getting lost. Project preparation We created a QGIS project with the Spot image and a layer to collect the ground data . We first converted our Spot image to a Geopackage raster, and built pyramids so as to get quick rendering in QField. The whole image (50 km2 at 1.5 m spatial resolution with 3 bands) weighted approximately 800 MB, which enabled us to load it in our tablet without the need to add any extra memory. We created a vector layer to draw our ground truth parcels (i.e. polygons of land cover parcels). It contained a field to identify the land cover type, some fields to take pictures and a field for eventual additional notes. We then uploaded the project in QField in our tablet. Field work On the field, we were able to move around easily in motorbike without getting lost, thanks to our location displayed on QField with the satellite image as background. When a parcel of interest was identified, we were able to draw its perimeter in QField and very easily fill-in the proper information on the attribute table (land cover type, pictures). When hesitating on the land cover type to attribute to a given parcel, we were able, in \"live\" (i.e. on the ground), to quickly look at previously retrieved parcels and compare them to the parcel of interest (with the pictures and the satellite image). We were able, without any extra effort at the end each field working day, to see the progress of the work: which pieces of our study area we had covered, which remained to explore, how many parcels we had got for each land cover class and how many remained to retrieve. This is very appreciable in such conditions, where work can be testing and nights can be shorts. Back in office, we did not have to realize fastidious and time-consuming work such as digitalizing the parcels from a traditional GPS point layer, linking the pictures to our land cover layer, etc., which traditionally took days of work. ::: {.container .clearer .text-center} {width=\"200px\"} {width=\"200px\"} {width=\"200px\"} {width=\"200px\"} :::","title":"Use of Qfield in the context of ground-truth data collection work of malaria transmitting mosquitoes"},{"location":"en/old-doc/case-studies/mosquito-malario-ground-truth-data-collection/#goal-and-field-constraints","text":"For a research work aiming at improving the knowledge on the environment of the mosquitoes that transmit malaria, the French Research Institute for Sustainable Development needed to generate a land cover map of two rural areas in Africa, one in Burkina Faso and one in Ivory Coast.

When a parcel of interest was identified, we were able to draw its perimeter in QField and very easily fill-in the proper information on the attribute table (land cover type, pictures). When hesitating on the land cover type to attribute to a given parcel, we were able, in \"live\" (i.e. on the ground), to quickly look at previously retrieved parcels and compare them to the parcel of interest (with the pictures and the satellite image). We were able, without any extra effort at the end each field working day, to see the progress of the work: which pieces of our study area we had covered, which remained to explore, how many parcels we had got for each land cover class and how many remained to retrieve. This is very appreciable in such conditions, where work can be testing and nights can be shorts. Back in office, we did not have to realize fastidious and time-consuming work such as digitalizing the parcels from a traditional GPS point layer, linking the pictures to our land cover layer, etc., which traditionally took days of work. ::: {.container .clearer .text-center} {width=\"200px\"} {width=\"200px\"} {width=\"200px\"} {width=\"200px\"} :::","title":"Field work"},{"location":"en/old-doc/case-studies/river-state-survey/","text":"Goal In order to assess the structural and morphological state of their water courses, the community of Milvignes needed to survey all the rivers crossing their territory.

It\\'s possible to add, delete and open them. The visual identification of the list entries are done a Display Expression on the child layer. Key handling Since the parents primary keys are used as foreign keys on the referencing child features, these primary keys must be save to use even after the synchronization back to the original data. Therefore we recommend to use stable values such as UUIDs for primary keys. Child features can be added before the parent is finaly saved - means while adding a parent. But it\\'s blocked if there is no valid primary key on the parent or the constraints are violated. In case the adding of the parent feature is canceled after there have been some childs added already, the childs are deleted by cascade. Many-To-Many relations On many-to-many relationships, according to the cardinality setting in the QGIS Vector Layer Properties, on adding, deleting or opening an entry in the list effects directly the child layer (on direct cardinality) or the linking table (on many-to-one cardinality). The second case is usually used when there are additional relation information (e.g. percentage) in the linking table. ::: {.container .clearer .text-center} {width=\"500px\"} ::: In case of the many-to-one cardinality on many-to-many relations the Display Expression needs to be set on the linking table.

They can be based on the geometry or expression variables. ::: {.container .clearer .text-center} {width=\"600px\"} ::: Additional variables In QField, there are some additional variables available regarding the current positioning information. [position_coordinate]{.title-ref} (Geometry in WGS84!) : Lon, Lat, Altitude as delivered by the sensor. Is also available when the crosshair is not snapped to the sensor. [position_timestamp]{.title-ref} (DateTime) : Timestamp of the position information [position_direction]{.title-ref} (float) : Direction in degrees from true north. [position_ground_speed]{.title-ref} (float) : Groundspeed in meters / second. [position_magnetic_variation]{.title-ref} (float) : The angle between the horizontal component of the magnetic field and true north, in degrees. Also known as magnetic declination. A positive value indicates a clockwise direction from true north and a negative value indicates a counter-clockwise direction. [position_horizontal_accuracy]{.title-ref} (float) : The horizontal accuracy of the coordinate (in meters). [position_vertical_accuracy]{.title-ref} (float) : The vertical accuracy of the coordinate (in meters). [position_vertical_speed]{.title-ref} (float) : The value of the vertical speed in meters per second. Common use cases Insert positioning information as variable: @position_horizontal_accuracy Insert the current date and time: now() Insert the length of the digitized line: length($geometry) Configure global variables on the device and insert them. @operator_name If you want to assign a region code based on the location where a new feature is inserted, you can do so by using an aggregate expression: aggregate( layer:='regions', aggregate:='max', expression:=\"code\", filter:=intersects( $geometry, geometry( @parent ) ) ) Editable The editable flag of fields is respected.

Configuring the offline editing functionality and synchronizing changes back. Workflow To get a quick overview of the process, here is a list of typical steps: Create a QField package. This is a working copy in a separate folder. Copy the QField package to the target device. Go out and collect data. Copy the modified data back to your desktop computer. Synchronize the modified data with your database or files. Installation In QGIS, open the plugin library and search for qfield sync . Select the plugin in the list and click on Install . ! Configuration The project configuration is saved in the master .qgs project file. This way it is possible to pre-configure a project once and use it repeatedly. Layer configuration In the project configuration dialog, an action can be defined for each layer individually. Depending on the layer type, different types of actions are available. Copy : The layer will be copied to the package folder. This is only available for file-based layers. No action : The layer source will be left untouched. This is only available for non-file-based layers like WMS, WFS, Postgis... Offline editing : A working copy of the layer is copied into the package folder. Every change which is done in the packaged project during work is recorded in a changelog. When synchronizing the changes back later on, this log will be replayed and all changes also be applied to the main data base. There is no conflict handling in place. Remove : The layer will be removed from the working copy. This is useful if a layer is used in the basemap and will not be available in the packaged project. Base map configuration A base map is a raster layer which is added as the bottommost layer to the packaged project file. If the base map option is enabled, a base map will be rendered, whenever the project is packaged. The area of interest - the extent which will be rendered -will be chosen at packaging time. There are two possible sources for a base map: Layer : A raster layer. This is useful to take an offline copy of an online layer like a WMS or to take a working copy of an unsupported format like an ECW or MrSID layer. Map Theme : A map theme. This is useful to create a base map based on a combination of several layers with styling. These layers can then be removed from the working package and do not need to be rendered on the device. This can save some disk space and battery on the device. The tile size defines the spatial resolution. It determines the number of map units per pixel. If the map canvas CRS has meters as units and tile size is set to 1, each raster pixel will have a spatial extent of 1x1 m, if it is set to 1000, each raster pixel will have a spatial extent of 1 square kilometer. Offline editing configuration If only synchronize features in area of interest is checked, only features which are within the extent of the map canvas as packaging time will be copied to the offline editing working copy. Package for Qfield Once the project is configured, package it in a folder. This folder will contain the .qgs and the data used in it. Copy the folder on your device. Open Qfield, open the project and start collecting data. Make also sure to save the QGIS project using the regular Save As of QGIS as you\\'ll have to re-open it later when you want to synchronize the changes. Synchronize from Qfield When you want to synchronize what you have collected, re-open the project in QGIS (the one you saved with a regular Save As). Copy the project folder from your device to your computer and use the Synchronize from Qfield menu to synchronize your changes from the protable project to the main project. Make sure that you synchronize your data back only once.

When synchronizing the changes back later on, this log will be replayed and all changes also be applied to the main data base. There is no conflict handling in place. Remove : The layer will be removed from the working copy. This is useful if a layer is used in the basemap and will not be available in the packaged project.","title":"Layer configuration"},{"location":"en/synchronise/qfieldsync/#base-map-configuration","text":"A base map is a raster layer which is added as the bottommost layer to the packaged project file. If the base map option is enabled, a base map will be rendered, whenever the project is packaged. The area of interest - the extent which will be rendered -will be chosen at packaging time. There are two possible sources for a base map: Layer : A raster layer. This is useful to take an offline copy of an online layer like a WMS or to take a working copy of an unsupported format like an ECW or MrSID layer. Map Theme : A map theme. This is useful to create a base map based on a combination of several layers with styling. These layers can then be removed from the working package and do not need to be rendered on the device. This can save some disk space and battery on the device. The tile size defines the spatial resolution. It determines the number of map units per pixel. If the map canvas CRS has meters as units and tile size is set to 1, each raster pixel will have a spatial extent of 1x1 m, if it is set to 1000, each raster pixel will have a spatial extent of 1 square kilometer.","title":"Base map configuration"},{"location":"en/synchronise/qfieldsync/#offline-editing-configuration","text":"If only synchronize features in area of interest is checked, only features which are within the extent of the map canvas as packaging time will be copied to the offline editing working copy.","title":"Offline editing configuration"},{"location":"en/synchronise/qfieldsync/#package-for-qfield","text":"Once the project is configured, package it in a folder.
